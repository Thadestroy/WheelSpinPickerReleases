## Automation System

Automations let you respond to Twitch events automatically. Access via the **Automations** button in the main window.

### Trigger Types

**Channel Point Redemptions**
- Link to reward titles (auto-detects reward IDs)
- Load wheels, play sounds, increment counters
- Send custom chat responses

**Walk-on Sounds (First Message Per Stream)**
- Play audio when specific users first chat each stream
- Option to only trigger when live (ignore "starting soon" screens)
- Perfect for VIP/sub walk-on sounds

**Bits**
- Trigger on exact bit amounts (e.g., exactly 100 bits)
- Great for special effects or wheel spins

**Gift Subs**
- Trigger when someone gifts an exact number of subs
- Celebrate gift sub trains with sounds or wheels

**Custom Chat Commands**
- Create your own commands (e.g., `!gamepicker`, `!minigame`)
- Set permission levels (everyone, subs, VIPs, mods, broadcaster)
- Load wheels with or without auto-spin

### Automation Actions

Each automation can perform multiple actions:
- **Load & Spin Wheel** - choose any saved preset, optionally auto-spin
- **Play Sound** - queue audio files with volume control (0-200%)
- **Send Chat Message** - respond with custom text (supports variables)
- **Increment Counter** - update global or per-user counters

### Message Variables

Use these in chat messages and entry actions:
- `{winner}` - the winning entry's text
- `{user}` - the user who triggered the automation
- `{wheel}` - the current wheel's name
- `{entry}` - alias for `{winner}`
- `{count}` - display counter value (after increment of that automation)
- `{counter:CounterName}` - display value of a specfic counter (auto detects for per-user based off Twitch account)

**Example:** `"Congrats {user}! The wheel landed on {winner}! Total wins: {count}"`

**Tips:**
- The left control panel won't be captured if you crop correctly
- Winner overlay appears centered on the wheel
- Pointer is always on the right side of the wheel

## Use Cases

| Scenario | How To |
|----------|--------|
| **Viewer Giveaway** | `!startwheelspin` → viewers `!join` → `!spinwheel` |
| **Game Selection** | Create a preset with game names → Quick Launch → Spin |
| **Channel Points - Auto Spin** | Create automation: reward → load wheel + auto-spin |
| **Walk-on Sounds** | Create automation: first message → play sound for specific users |
| **Bits Celebration** | Create automation: 100 bits → play sound + increment counter |
| **Custom Chat Command** | Create automation: `!gamepicker` (mods+) → load wheel + auto-spin |
| **Cascading Wheels** | Entry action: trigger automation → loads second wheel when entry wins |
| **Stream Deck** | Create automation with custom command → bind to Stream Deck button |

---

## Queue System

The app has two separate queues (view in left panel):

### Wheel Queue
- Pending wheel loads and spins
- Shows what's coming next from automations or commands
- Controls: **Pause**, **Skip**, **Clear**

### Sound Queue
- Audio files waiting to play
- Switch tabs to view current sounds
- Controls: **Pause**, **Skip**, **Clear**

**Queue Behavior:**
- Wheel queue processes one item at a time
- Sound queue plays audio files sequentially
- Pausing prevents new items from starting
- Skipping moves to the next item immediately

## Counters

Create and manage counters via the **Automations** window.

### Counter Types

**Global Counter:**
- Single shared value across all users
- Example: "Deaths This Stream", "Wheels Spun Today"

**Per-User Counter:**
- Separate value for each Twitch user
- Example: "Times Won", "Appearances on Wheel"
- Automatically tracks display names

### Counter Settings
- **Name** - display name for the counter
- **Scope** - Global or Per-User

### Using Counters
Increment counters from:
- Automation rules (when triggered)
- Entry actions (when entry wins)

View counter values in the Automations window or use `{count}` in messages.

## Tips & Tricks

### Hands-Free Streaming
- Set up chat commands for everything
- Let mods control the wheel via chat
- Use channel points for viewer-driven spins

### Cascading Wheels
1. Create multiple wheel presets (e.g., "Category Picker" and "Game Picker")
2. Add entry action: "Trigger Automation"
3. The triggered automation loads the next wheel
4. Result: winning "Survival" loads a wheel of Survival games!

### Walk-on Sounds for Viewers
1. Create automation: "First Message Per Stream" → specific username
2. Set "Only When Live" to avoid triggering during setup
3. Add sound file with volume adjusted

### Stream Deck Integration
1. Create custom command automation (e.g., `!quickspin`)
2. Set permission to "Broadcaster Only"
3. In Stream Deck, use "Twitch Chat" action
4. Send message: `!quickspin`
5. One-button wheel launch!

### Tracking Statistics
- Use global counters for stream-wide stats
- Use per-user counters to track viewer participation
- Display counter values in chat messages with `{count}` (Used when a counter increments)
- Display specfic counter value in chat messages with `{counter:CounterName}` (Used to show saved count)
